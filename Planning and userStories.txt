1) Jerry, age 41, is an Draftsman for a small Architectural firm in San Antonio. He has been online shopping
extensively over the past few years due to the pandemic. He sticks to the larger online stores that he is
familiar with because he does not like giving out his information, and forgets passwords easily. He 
doesn't shop for clothes much online because he likes to try things on in person, but he buys a lot of gift cards
for family around the holidays. 

2) Kaine, age 17, is a high school student for a small town near San Antonio. She wants to buy Christmas gifts for her family but 
can't go to the store personally due to bad weather. She would like to see all available items to purchase and well as size, available color,
discounts, and type. She would also like to see her order status as well since Christmas is around the corner and her clothes need to get here
fast! 

3) Alex, age 23, is a recent college graduate working a remote internship at a startup company. Due to a busy schedule and long work hours, 
he doesn't have much energy to go out to the mall and shop for himself or others. Howeverr, due to the decrease of COVID-19 cases, his project  
manager has just informed that they will be returning to the office in 2 weeks. Alex looks at his closet and starts trying on clothes since he 
will have to dress for work now. He notices that he doesnt have much professional attire and decides to hop online and shop for some clothes. 
After looking at a few stores online, he isn't satisfied with the options he has viewed thus far. He recalls "our store name" from his friend 
mentioning it over brunch a few days ago. Alex wanst to see different styles as well as different colors so that he can make a variety of outfits 
without breaking the bank. He would like to see the total cost of his cart before purchase. Another thing he would like is a confirmation 
number when he places his order.

User Scenarios
----------------------------------------------------------
1) Jerry Gets in from work around 7 and remembers that his newphews birthday is two days from now. He has major deadlines at work and won't be able to shop. He remembers
the website "Our website name" from a conversation he had a few days earlier with his sister. He decides to see if they have gift cards. 
Jerry Googles "Our website name". He knows that his newphew wears a child's medium because He went clothes shopping at Christmas. He also knows he can't spend more than 
he spent on his niece or she might be upset. Jerry goes to the website and scrolls around until he finds something he thinks his nephew might like. After that, he checks to 
make sure it comes in the correct size, and is available for rush delivery. He selects a shirt he wants and puts it into the cart. There is also an option to
check out immediately. Jerry decides to add the item to the cart and keep shopping. He finds a matching hat to go with the shirt. He looks at his total and finds that he 
has hit his budget. He clicks the checkout button and opens the payment information. He enters his payment information. There is a message that he could sign up for an 
account to preserve his cart and payment information. Jerry opts to sign up. He enters his name, email, and password and registers. After he registers he is given a message
confirming his registration. After this is taken back to the cart to complete payment. 

2) Kaine finally gets her first paycheck today, and decides to use this money to buy Christmas clothes for herself and her family. She goes to our website and since she already 
created an account the previous week, she doesn't need to sign in again. Kaine would like to see all of the clothes based on discount. She searches through the catalogue and sees the 
clothes that she wants. She is terrible at math and doesn't know how much money she is spending. She opens up her shopping cart and can see
how much she is spending, including tax and discounts. She reaches her budget limit and clicks on the payment button and it takes her to a payment page.
She enters her information and is taken to a order status page that she can track at any time. The order status page will tell her the approximate
date the order is going to arrive, as well as show what tier it on. For example, the order is still being "processed", or the order is "on way".
Kaine sees that this might take a while and since Christmas is around the corner, opts in the pay and extra fee to get "VIP shipping" which will 
dramatically decrease the shipping time of her order and give her priority over other orders.
