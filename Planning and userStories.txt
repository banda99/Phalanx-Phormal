1) Jerry, age 41, is an Draftsman for a small Architectural firm in San Antonio. He has been online shopping
extensively over the past few years due to the pandemic. He sticks to the larger online stores that he is
familiar with because he does not like giving out his information, and forgets passwords easily. He 
doesn't shop for clothes much online because he likes to try things on in person, but he buys a lot of gift cards
for family around the holidays. 

2) Kaine, age 17, is a high school student for a small town near San Antonio. She wants to buy Christmas gifts for her family but 
can't go to the store personally due to bad weather. She would like to see all available items to purchase and well as size, available color,
discounts, and type. She would also like to see her order status as well since Christmas is around the corner and her clothes need to get here
fast!
