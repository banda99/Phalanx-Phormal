1) Jerry, age 41, is an Draftsman for a small Architectural firm in San Antonio. He has been online shopping
extensively over the past few years due to the pandemic. He sticks to the larger online stores that he is
familiar with because he does not like giving out his information, and forgets passwords easily. He 
doesn't shop for clothes much online because he likes to try things on in person, but he buys a lot of gift cards
for family around the holidays.
